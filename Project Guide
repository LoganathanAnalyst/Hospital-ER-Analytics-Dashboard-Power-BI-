Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to build three essential views for the Hospital ER Power BI
dashboard:
1. Monthly View — time-series and month-over-month performance for operational KPIs.
2. Consolidated View — executive summary combining KPIs, bed utilization, staff metrics.
3. Patient View — granular patient-level analytics and drillthrough details.
Each section covers:
- Data required
- Power Query / ETL steps
- Data modeling & relationships
- Key DAX measures
- Visuals & layout recommendations
- Interactions, filters & bookmarks
- Testing & validation
- Deployment notes

1) MONTHLY VIEW
Purpose: Show trends over months to identify seasonality, workloads, and capacity planning.
Data Required:
- PatientArrival table: PatientID, ArrivalDateTime, ArrivalMode, TriageLevel
- Treatment table: PatientID, TreatmentStart, TreatmentEnd, Disposition
- BedUsage table: Date, BedID, Status (Occupied/Available)
- StaffShifts table: StaffID, ShiftDate, Role, HoursWorked
Power Query (ETL) Steps:
- Parse datetime fields: ensure ArrivalDateTime, TreatmentStart/End are DateTime types.
- Create a Calendar table: Date, Year, Month, MonthNumber, MonthYear (e.g., '2025-11')
- Aggregate tables by month where needed (e.g., monthly patient counts).
- Fill down missing triage levels if possible or mark as Unknown.
- Convert durations: TreatmentDuration = Duration in minutes between TreatmentEnd and TreatmentStart.
Data Modeling:
- Use star schema:
- DimDate (Calendar) as central date dimension
- FactPatientEvents (PatientID, DateKey, ArrivalCount=1, TreatmentDuration, TriageLevel, Disposition)
- DimStaff, DimBed, DimTriageLevels
- Relationship: FactPatientEvents[DateKey] -> DimDate[DateKey]; FactPatientEvents[StaffID] -> DimStaff[StaffID],
etc.
Key DAX Measures (examples):
- Monthly Patient Count:
Monthly Patients = DISTINCTCOUNT(FactPatientEvents[PatientID])
- Avg Waiting Time (minutes):
Avg Wait (min) = AVERAGEX(FactPatientEvents, FactPatientEvents[WaitDurationMinutes])
- Treatment Time Avg:
Avg Treatment (min) = AVERAGEX(FactPatientEvents, FactPatientEvents[TreatmentDuration])
- Bed Utilization % (monthly):
Bed Utilization % =
DIVIDE(
SUM(BedUsage[OccupiedHours]),
SUM(BedUsage[TotalHours])
)
- MoM Growth:
Patients MoM % =
DIVIDE(
[Monthly Patients] - CALCULATE([Monthly Patients], DATEADD(DimDate[Date], -1, MONTH)),
CALCULATE([Monthly Patients], DATEADD(DimDate[Date], -1, MONTH))
)
Visuals & Layout:
- Top row: KPI cards (Monthly Patients, Avg Wait, Avg Treatment, Bed Utilization %)
- Middle: Line chart — Patients by Month (use continuous axis), with slicer for Year
- Right: Column chart — Avg Wait by Month; Area chart for Bed Utilization
- Bottom: Table or matrix with Month, Patients, Avg Wait, Avg Treatment, % Change
- Use small multiples if splitting by Triage Level or Arrival Mode
Interactions & Filters:
- Slicer: Year, Department (if multiple), Triage Level
- Enable cross-filtering: clicking a month filters other visuals
- Add drillthrough to Patient View for that month's patient list
Testing & Validation:
- Compare monthly counts to source extracts (CSV/Excel) using same date logic
- Validate treatment durations by spot-checking 10 random records
- Check for timezone issues: ensure datetime fields align with hospital local time

2) CONSOLIDATED VIEW
Purpose: Executive summary — one-page snapshot for leadership with trends and capacity signals.
Data Required:
- Aggregated KPI facts (daily or hourly), bed inventory, staffing summary, top issues
- Reference tables: Departments, Units, ShiftPatterns
ETL Steps:
- Pre-aggregate heavy tables to daily granularity: daily patient count, daily avg wait, daily bed occupancy
- Create summary tables: DepartmentSummary, StaffLoadSummary
- Compute rolling metrics: 7-day avg wait time, 30-day avg patients
Data Modeling:
- Keep a FactDailyKPI table keyed by DateKey with measures pre-calculated (or computed via DAX)
- Connect DimDate to FactDailyKPI
- Use role-playing dimensions if needed (e.g., AdmissionDate vs DischargeDate)
Key DAX Measures:
- Current Day Patients = CALCULATE([Daily Patients], LASTDATE(DimDate[Date]))
- 7-day Average Wait = AVERAGEX(DATESINPERIOD(DimDate[Date], LASTDATE(DimDate[Date]), -7, DAY),
[Avg Wait (min)])
- Occupancy Alert Flag:
Occupancy Alert = IF([Bed Utilization %] > 0.85, "High", "Normal")
Visuals & Layout:
- Header: Big KPIs (Today Patients, Current Wait Time, Occupancy %, Staff Shortage Flag)
- Left: Gauge or bullet chart for Occupancy % with threshold lines
- Center: Compact trend charts (sparkline) for last 30 days
- Right: Top 5 issues (e.g., longest waits, departments with most backlogs)
- Footer: Suggested actions (text box) and data freshness info
Interactions & UX:
- Use bookmarks to switch between 'Normal' and 'Alert' layouts (showing recommendations)
- Use tooltip pages for deeper context on each KPI
- Create 'Export to PDF' button via Power Automate (if integrated) for daily reports
Testing & Validation:
- Ensure pre-aggregated numbers match ad-hoc calculations
- Validate alert thresholds with clinical team
- Test bookmark states and visibility toggles

3) PATIENT VIEW (Granular)
Purpose: Patient-level exploration — supports operational teams and clinicians to trace individual journeys.
Data Required:
- Patient master: PatientID, Name (or pseudonymized ID), DOB, Gender
- Arrival events: ArrivalDateTime, Mode, TriageLevel
- Treatment events: TreatmentStart, TreatmentEnd, TreatingStaffID, Department
- Disposition: Discharged/Admitted/Transferred, DischargeDateTime
- Other optional: Diagnosis codes, Procedure codes
ETL Steps:
- Clean PatientID for consistent keys; consider pseudonymization for PHI protection
- Calculate event timestamps and durations: WaitDuration = TreatmentStart - ArrivalDateTime
- Create a 'PatientTimeline' fact with ordered events for each PatientID
- Create flags for long-wait (WaitDuration > threshold), readmission within X days, etc.
Data Modeling:
- FactPatientTimeline linked to DimPatient, DimDate, DimStaff, DimDepartment
- Consider using composite keys for event ordering if necessary
Key DAX Measures & Calculated Columns:
- WaitDurationMinutes (calculated column in Power Query or DAX)
- IsLongWait = IF([WaitDurationMinutes] > 120, 1, 0) -- example threshold
- Patient Total Time in ER = DATEDIFF(MIN(FactPatientTimeline[ArrivalDateTime]),
MAX(FactPatientTimeline[DispositionDateTime]), MINUTE)
- ReadmissionWithin7Days = measure comparing patient events
Visuals & Layout:
- Top: Patient selector (search box) or slicer (PatientID or anonymized name)
- Left: Patient summary card (Arrival, TriageLevel, TreatmentTime, Disposition)
- Center: Timeline visual (Gantt-like) showing arrival → triage → treatment → discharge
- Right: Events table (chronological) with ability to click to see full event details
- Bottom: Related Patients (e.g., same diagnosis) and patient notes (if permitted)
Interactions & Privacy:
- Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) to limit access to PHI
- Pseudonymize patient names in shared environments
- Log access / auditing if required by hospital policy
Testing & Validation:
- Verify individual patient timelines against source EMR for sample patients
- Confirm duration calculations for edge cases (missing end times)
- Ensure RLS works correctly by testing with test users

Common Best Practices Across All Views
- Use a centralized DimDate and consistent DateKey across facts.
- Prefer Power Query for heavy transformation; DAX for on-the-fly calculations.
- Keep visuals simple: use 3–5 colors, clear titles, and tooltips.
- Add data refresh timestamp on all dashboards.
- Document assumptions (e.g., how wait time is calculated) in a 'Notes' page.
- Performance: disable 'Auto Date/Time', use calculated tables sparingly, and optimize relationships.
- Accessibility: ensure alt text for visuals and readable font sizes.
Deployment & Publishing
- Publish to Power BI Service workspace dedicated to Clinical Ops
- Configure dataset refresh: schedule nightly or more frequently depending on need
- Setup Row-Level Security before sharing with operational staff
- Share dashboards via Apps for controlled distribution
Appendix — Useful DAX Snippets
- Moving Average (7 days):
Moving Avg 7 = AVERAGEX(DATESINPERIOD(DimDate[Date], LASTDATE(DimDate[Date]), -7, DAY), [Daily
Patients])
- Distinct Patients in Period:
Distinct Patients = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(FactPatientEvents[PatientID]),
DATESBETWEEN(DimDate[Date], STARTDATE, ENDDATE))
- Time Difference in Minutes:
WaitMinutes = DATEDIFF(FactPatientEvents[ArrivalDateTime], FactPatientEvents[TreatmentStart], MINUTE)
Notes on Sensitive Data (PHI)
- Only include personally identifiable information (PII) when necessary and permitted.
- Prefer anonymized IDs for shared dashboards.
- Follow hospital data governance and encryption for dataset storage.
